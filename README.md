# fluent-logger-scala -A Scala structured logger for Fluentd-

Many web/mobile applications generate huge amount of event logs (c,f. login, logout, purchase, follow, etc). To analyze these event logs could be really valuable for improving the service. However, the challenge is collecting these logs easily and reliably.


[Fluentd](http://github.com/fluent/fluentd) solves that problem by having: easy installation, small footprint, plugins, reliable buffering, log forwarding, etc.

**fluent-logger-scala** is a Scala library, to record the events from Scala application,  based on fluent-logger-java.
Main difference between scala and java version is to support Scala Collection.

Please see [QuickStart](https://github.com/oza/fluent-logger-scala/wiki/QuickStart) to get started!

## Installation(for scala 2.10.0 or later)

Add sonatype repository and dependencies to build.sbt file as follows:

    resolvers += "Apache Maven Central Repository" at "http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/"
    
    libraryDependencies += "org.fluentd" % "fluent-logger-scala_<scala_version>" % "0.5.0"
    

Please replace ```<scala_version>``` with scala compiler version you use.
Currently, ```<scala_version>``` can be replaced with 2.10 or 2.11.
For instance,

    libraryDependencies += "org.fluentd" % "fluent-logger-scala_2.10" % "0.5.0"

or

    libraryDependencies += "org.fluentd" % "fluent-logger-scala_2.11" % "0.5.0"

## Installation(for scala 2.9)

We provide old version of fluent-logger-scala for scala 2.9.


    libraryDependencies += "org.fluentd" % "fluent-logger-scala_2.9.0" % "0.4.0"

or

    libraryDependencies += "org.fluentd" % "fluent-logger-scala_2.9.1" % "0.4.0"

or

    libraryDependencies += "org.fluentd" % "fluent-logger-scala_2.9.2" % "0.4.0"



## API

APIs base on fluent-logger-java.

    FluentLoggerFactory#getLogger(tag: String): FluentLogger
    FluentLoggerFactory#getLogger(tag: String, host: String, port: Int): FluentLogger
    FluentLoggerFactory#getLogger(tag: String, host: String, port: Int, timeout: Int, bufferCapacity: Int): FluentLogger
    FluentLoggerFactory#flushAll(): Unit
    FluentLoggerFactory#closeAll(): Unit

    FluentLogger#log(label: String, key: String, value: Any): Boolean
    FluentLogger#log(label: String, key: String, value: Any, timestamp: Long): Boolean
    FluentLogger#log(tag:String, mutableMap/immutableMap[String, Any]):Boolean
    FluentLogger#flush()
    FluentLogger#close()

## How to Build from source


## Build

    ./sbt update
    ./sbt compile

## Test

    ./sbt test

## For developers

### Publishing to sonatype repository

Describe your account information in $HOME/.sbt/(sbt-version)/sonatype.sbt file:

    credentials += Credentials("Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager",
        "oss.sonatype.org",
        "(Sonatype user name)",
        "(Sonatype password)")

Then publish a signed artifact to the Sonatype repository:

    ./sbt publishSigned

Make sure you are using a release version in build.sbt file. A SNAPSHOT version is deployed to the snapshot repostitory of Sonatype, which is not synched with Maven central. 

After publishing, you can close, promote and drop the published repositorty with sonatypeRelease command:

    ./sbt sonatypeRelease
